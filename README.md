* Problem 1: 3 ways to sum to n
* Problem 2: Fancy Form
* Problem 3: Messy React
* For Problem 3, I created an React App and the files that I have modified is in the src folder and inside there is the WalletPage.tsx, plus there's 2 other folders components and hooks that I created that contain the neccessary components and hooks as well :D
